The proyect is developed in ReactJS using functional components and React hooks (useState and useEffect).
Axios for fetching the JSON data and Lazy Loading for improving the images loading & cache.

## Folders:
- /api -> All feching goes here
- /componets -> Every component it's in a diferent folder with their own .css & testing
- /constants -> All text goes here
- App.js -> Works as Home. It's a small app so no pages or React Router yet
